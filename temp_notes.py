#### Chapter 2: Kinematics in 1 dimension (Rectilinear Motion)
"""
space+time create an event/occurrence

particles (objects), mass

units bear great importance in physics

units of space, distance such as metre:

MKS: metre, kilogram, second

CGS: cm, gram,

All physical quantities in this course are describable using units: Metres, Kilogramss, seconds

learning outcomes:
-describe what a particle is
-define position, distance, displacement, speed, velocity, and acceleration of a particle in rectilinear motion
-write relationships between postion and velocity of particle in rectilinear motion under uniform constant acceleration as function of time
-solve for two of them given third. requires an understanding of appropriate initial conditions in each case
-describe physical interpretation of position, velocity, and acceleration of particle
-identify and analyse special case of rectilinear motion
-solve problems involving uniform acceleartion, acceleration due to gravity with no resistance


**Reference frame**
reference frame is coordinate system relative to  which motion and rest may be measured; measurement of position, distance, speed, must be made with respect to reference frame.

Concept of Inertial reference frame
--- moving at rate/speed without changing direction



**distinction between distance, displacement**:
-displacement is how far object is from starting point, regardless of how it got there
-distnace traveled is the length of the actual path, or measured along the actual path traveled


-displacement is written as: \delta[x] = x_2 - x_1
-displacement depends on initial, and final position only

-displacement is a vector; vector is quantity with magnitude and direction; scalar is quantity of only magnitude


one dimensional motion = rectilinear motion = linear motion
where movement happens only on one spatial dimesion

avg speed = distance travelled/time elapsed = d/(delta t) where d is distance, and t is time

avg velocity = displacement/time elapsed = delta x / delta t
